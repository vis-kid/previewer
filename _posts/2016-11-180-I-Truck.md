On the road, when I look into my rear mirror, I don’t see myself. I feel like a man that looks at the world through a purple tainted windscreen. My face is absent in the mirror to my left. It only shows me other people passing by. A hairy arm that is a lot darker and more wrinkly than my right arm which is still white and more youthful. When I stroke over my beard, I can even feel the deeper wrinkles on the left side of my face. The road takes a toll, a few pennies every day. Truckin’ aint easy, it aint the future. Our bunch is going nowhere, into the past. And we know it.

Loneliness is not my enemy. I’m used to be a stranger among strangers. There is comradery in friendly indifference. Not much, but enough for me. I don’t have dreams anymore. They have been washed away by lightening storms and too much heat. Our jobs require sacrifices, we know that the road ahead is less open than it used to be. The world didn’t change, the roads are still as I remember them. People are different though. I look out the window, see the people rushing towards skies that they hope are blue.
